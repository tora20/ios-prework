# Prework - Prework Welcome App

Submitted by: Toya Ora

Prework Welcome App is an app that introduces me as a prework step to learning iOS.

Time spent: About 1-2 hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Users are see a screen with three labels and a button
- [x] Tapping the button changes the screen color to a random color

## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

## Notes

This was my first time learning to build an app with XCode and swift language. Understanding how to use XCode's interface to change the iPhone editor screen was the most challenging, and it seems that the interface has changed quite a bit from older versions.
