App idea:

Think of an app idea that you would like to build. It can be a new idea or an improvement on an existing app. Write a short paragraph describing the app and the features you would like to implement. You are not committing to this idea, but it helps to start brainstorming early on and get feedback from your peers and instructors.


## Notes

This was my first time learning to build an app with XCode and Swift language. Understanding how to use XCode's interface to change the iPhone editor screen was the most challenging, and it seems that the interface has changed quite a bit from older versions seen in online tutorials.
