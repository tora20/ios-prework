App idea:

An app that allows people to report autonomous vehicle accidents that happen on the road so that manufacturers, governments and other parties may obtain a log of this information via region to help inform safer regulations. The app would proactively alert drivers of potential safety hazards on their route specifically for an autonomous vehicle so that they can proactively address those hazards or change their route to a more autonomous vehicle friendly route.


## Notes

This was my first time learning to build an app with XCode and Swift language. Understanding how to use XCode's interface to change the iPhone editor screen was the most challenging, and it seems that the interface has changed quite a bit from older versions seen in online tutorials.
